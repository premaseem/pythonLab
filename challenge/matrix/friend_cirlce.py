# There are N students in a class.
# Some of them are friends, while some are not.
# Their friendship is transitive in nature, i.e., if A is friend of B and B is friend of C, then A is also friend of C.
# A friend circle is a group of students who are directly or indirectly friends.
#
# You are given a NÃ—N - matrix M which consists of characters Y or N.
# If M[i][j]=Y, then ith and jth students are friends with each other, otherwise not.
# You have to print the total number of friend circles in the class.
#
# Each element of matrix friends will be Y or N.
# Number of rows and columns will be equal in the matrix.
#
# M[i][i]=Y, where 0=i<N
# M[i][j] = M[j][i], where 0=i<j<N
#
# Example 1

# Input:
# YYNN
# YYYN
# NYYN
# NNNY
# Output: 2
#
# Example 2

# Input
# YNNNN
# NYNNN
# NNYNN
# NNNYN
# NNNNY
# Output: 5

# ALGO :
# 1. populate the values in matrix
# find disjoin circle and increment the number
