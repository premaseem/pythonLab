# Machine Learning 

Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).
Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

# Definition
Machine Leaarning enables a functions / program to predict the outcome based on what it have learned for dataset.

# Data Set
In the mind of a computer, a data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database.

We can split the data types into three main categories:

Numerical - Integers
Categorical - data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value,
Ordinal - data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.

In Machine Learning (and in mathematics) there are often three values that interests us:
Mean - The average value 
Median - The mid point value (after sorting)
Mode - The most common value
